# Parsimony Tree Constructor

Python code that constructs a phylogenetic tree (evolutionary history) from the DNA sequences of a group of taxa. Uses a maximum parsimony approach to find the best tree and implements Fitch's algorithm to score all possible trees.

Developed as part of a course project for the BridgeUp:STEM high school educational program at AMNH; parts of the code were scaffolded for the students but the full code and solution is uploaded here.

This project was designed and implemented in conjunction with Lillie Schachter.
